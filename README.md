# ScratchTreeClassifier

## 4 different decision trees:
Construction of each Decision tree classifier from scratch found in DecisionTree.ipynb
- Decision tree with one determinant on every feature, measuring uncertainty with misclassification
- Decision tree with one determinant on every feature, measuring uncertainty with gini index
- Decision tree with that decides any feature as a determinant that minimize uncertainty, measuring uncertainty with misclassification
- Decision tree with that decides any feature as a determinant that minimize uncertainty, measuring uncertainty with gini index

### After each tree has conducted, I have ran K-fold validation test on each tree and found the best performing tree
### Data used to train the model could be found in data/
